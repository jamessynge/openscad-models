Second draft of a design for weatherproofing the iEQ30Pro mount.

Author: James Synge

Approach: build a ring around the RA axis that is secured against rotation at
both ends of the DEC axis. Use that ring as the base to which other
weatherproofing is attached.

At the counterweight (CW) shaft end of the DEC body, we need a ring around the
CW shaft to keep water from entering the bearing. So we will have a sleeve
around the lower end of the DEC body, extending over the CW shaft by a
reasonable distance, along with a ring attached to the CW shaft itself, just
slightly smaller in diameter than the inner diameter of the sleeve. The sleeve
should probably be tapered at the bottom so that water will run out.

The first draft included a "chin strap" for securing the DEC motor cover
over the DEC motor. This will be combined with a similar strap for the RA
axis, which will help prevent rotation around either axis.

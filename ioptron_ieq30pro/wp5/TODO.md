# TO DOs for Weatherproofing Design

## TO DOs for the helmet

*  Add bosses for securing.

*  Consider increasing thickness to rtp_boss_diam (i.e. m4_washer_diam * 1.5),
   to allow for the screw and nut supports to be entirely inside the walls...
   if that works.

*  Design a tab and slot for alignment of top and bottom quarters of each half,
   and for the outer edge of the DEC head opening.

### TO DOs for the lid

*  Add a polar scope port to the lid, flush with the top. Requires a little
   silicone caulk or similar to waterproof the opening when the cap is in place.
   Might be best to apply a thin ring of material to the lid without the cap
   in place, and allow to cure before putting the cap in place.

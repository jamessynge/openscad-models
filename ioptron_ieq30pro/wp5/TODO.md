# TO DOs for Weatherproofing Design

## TO DOs for the helmet

*  Consider whether to merge the lid and nut-side top into a single part.
   This would eliminate a gluing step, but complicate printing.

*  Design a tab and slot for alignment of top and bottom quarters of each half,
   and for the outer edge of the DEC head opening.

   *  Can be done by splitting each can_gluing_shelf into 3 parts, two at the
      ends for the top (or bottom) quarter, and another in the middle for the
      other quarter. This will work just as well for gluing, but will also
      "lock" the two quarters together so that they don't slide out of position
      while gluing (i.e. they can' rotate around the RA axis, and they can't
      slide in/out along the radii of the RA axis).

### TO DOs for the lid

*  Add a polar scope port to the lid, flush with the top. Requires a little
   silicone caulk or similar to waterproof the opening when the cap is in place.
   Might be best to apply a thin ring of material to the lid without the cap
   in place, and allow to cure before putting the cap in place.

### TO DOs for the nut-side

### TO DOs for the screw-side

### TO DOs for the bottom

### TO DOs for the top

*  Put inverted can_gluing_shelf on the top side of each half, to prevent the
   helmet from sliding down the can supports.

# OBSOLETE / REJECTED

*  Consider increasing thickness to rtp_boss_diam (i.e. m4_washer_diam * 1.5),
   to allow for the screw and nut supports to be entirely inside the walls...
   if that works.

Fourth draft of a design for weatherproofing the iEQ30Pro mount.

Author: James Synge

Approach: Extending the third draft (weatherproofing_2), create a helmet for
the entire moving portion of the RA and DEC axes,
but closer fitting than in weatherproofing_2 by creating hulls of the rotating
portion of the DEC axis (DEC head) and the effectively rotating portion of the
RA axis RELATIVE TO the moving part of the RA and DEC axes, i.e. the RA motor
and electronics, etc. These don't move, except when view from the perspective
of the moving side of the RA axis.

Extra Considerations:

*  Given the large internal support structures, we need to make sure
   that water which does enter has a place to go. For example, at the
   counterwieght shaft hole, some water will undoubtedly enter the enclosure. We need to allow it to run down between the inside of
   the enclosure rather than penetrate to the mount. To allow for use
   at multiple latitudes, we can place small channels between the
   counterweight shaft and the bottom of the enclosure, radiating
   away so that some channel is down regardless of latitude (within
   limits).

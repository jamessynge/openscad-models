# TO DOs for Weatherproofing Design

## TO DOs for the helmet

*  Including a 1" diameter hole, with slightly smaller lip for a 1" diameter,
   1/8" thick clear acrylic disc so that
   the polar port can be used. This will have the advantage that the user won't
   have to put the helmet on in the dark... assuming the user has access to the
   latitude screw and the fine adjusment azimuth screws.

   *  Design a hollow screw to replace the polar port cover, one to which I can
      glue a 1" diameter clear acrylic disc. This will keep dirt out, while
      allowing the polar scope to be used .

*  Allow room for at least 4 screws, maybe 5, for fastening the two sides
   of the helmet together:

   *  At the bottom and top of the DEC port side of the helmet.
   *  At the bottom below the CW port.
   *  Near the center of the top, but not in the way of the polar scope line
      of sight.
   *  Maybe above the CW port.

*  Rather than a bump out below the CW port to reduce the angle of the overhang,
   look at cutting each half of the helmet again, into parts that can be glued
   together.

   *  This could mean cutting at the height of the DEC axis through the sides of
      the CW port, then angling down somehow to the bottom, i.e. to the rim that
      surrounds the RA axis and RA motor.

   *  
*  I

*  Figure out how to cut the helmet at the DEC head end so that the DEC rain
   plate (integral to the helmet now) has some overlap, i.e. not a perpendicular
   cut, but ideally either the nut-side overlaps the screw side, or there is a
   groove such that the two sides are easier to align with each other.

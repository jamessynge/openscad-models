Third draft of a design for weatherproofing the iEQ30Pro mount.

Author: James Synge

Approach: Create a single enclosure for the entire moving portion of the
RA and DEC axes, which keeps most water from getting anywhere near the bearings or electronics. This eliminates the need for overlapping parts and figuring out how to shed water from each in turn.

Extra Considerations:

*  Given the large internal support structures, we need to make sure
   that water which does enter has a place to go. For example, at the
   counterwieght shaft hole, some water will undoubtedly enter the enclosure. We need to allow it to run down between the inside of
   the enclosure rather than penetrate to the mount. To allow for use
   at multiple latitudes, we can place small channels between the
   counterweight shaft and the bottom of the enclosure, radiating
   away so that some channel is down regardless of latitude (within
   limits).

* Adjust cw_chin_strap_helmet_support so that it extends all the way to the 
  dec_chin_strap, with a bolt connecting them (e.g. nut_slot).

* Add ribs inside the helmet just below the RA bearing plane and above the
  interior supports (i.e. cw_chin_strap_helmet_support and dec_chin_strap),
  which should be good to avoid it flexing too much, but also to act as a
  guide for holding the helmet in place.

* Add a rib inside the helmet at the bottom. There is some risk of accumulating
  water, so consider a rib shape to compensate or leave a gap at the bottom.

* Place holes around the hoop support for glue in threaded inserts; place around
  six around the whole circumference, but use a function to decide which of them
  to include based on latitude. Insert corresponding holes into the DEC bearing
  rain shield (dec_bearing_outer_hoop). Consider using countersink style
  connections (ala the alignment cones) to guide the rain shield into the
  correct location.

* Design a screw & threaded insert connection for two halves of the helmet
  (cut vertically through the CW and DEC head). The screws would insert from
  the lower half (when parked), making it harder for water to get into the
  holes (NOT impossible... consider printing little blocks to go in on top
  of the screw heads).

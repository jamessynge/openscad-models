Weatherproofing the right ascension (RA) axis of the iOptron iEQ30 Pro
requires that the following constraints (English rather than formulas)
be taken into consideration:

* The DEC axis is horizontal when parked.

* The telescope is to the right of the mount when you stand behind the mount
  with the RA axis facing the nearest pole (i.e. on the east side when north
  of the equator).

* The DEC head is rotated such the dovetail plate & saddle horizontal, the
  DEC clutch is down and the saddle knobs are up.

* The plane of the DEC bearing intersects the RA axis motor cover when the
  DEC head is rotated to the certain angles, as it would be during normal
  operation.

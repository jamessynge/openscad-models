* CW - Counterweight; a German Equatorial Mount (such as the iEQ30) requires a
  counterweight to balance the payload (i.e. telescope). In fact, the iEQ30 Pro
  is not balanced even with no telescope and counterweight shaft due to the mass
  of the DEC worm gear, worm and motor.
* [DEC - Declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination). See RA below.
* DEC Motor
* [GEM - German Equatorial Mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_mount#German_equatorial_mount)
* mm - millimeters
* [RA - Right Ascension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension); along with Declination, these are the measurements astronomers use to specify where in the sky a celestial object is located. RA is analogous to Longitude, but applied to the celestial sphere rather than the surface of the earth.

Background on weatherproofing the iOptron iEQ30 Pro.

Author: James Synge

Weatherproofing the mount requires that the following constraints
(English rather than formulas) be taken into consideration:

* The latitude range is from ~zero to ~60 degrees, though the PANOPTES pier
  design probably doesn't work too well below perhaps 10 degrees.
  It would be best if the design accomodates a large range of latitudes.
  The closest site to the equator currently is on Hawaii, at 19 degrees north.
  I'm aiming to accomodate 19 to 60 degrees, but not closer to the equator than
  that. I think we'd need a wedge under the base of the mount to handle being
  closer to the equator, so this doesn't seem like a great limitation; iOptron
  offers their CEM series of mounts specifically to accomodate folks closer to
  the equator.

* The RA axis is rotated such that the DEC axis is horizontal when parked.

* The telescope is to the right of the mount when you stand behind the mount
  with the RA axis facing the nearest pole (i.e. on the east side when north
  of the equator). _Note: Wilfred suggests that it would be useful to support
  parking on either side of the mount in order to allow for local weather
  conditions (e.g. if storms at the site predominantly come from the east
  or west, we want our weatherproofing optimized for those conditions.
  Providing that support may primarily involve applying appropriate mirror
  operations._

* The RA axis clutch is at the bottom of the RA bearing cover when the
  DEC axis is horizontal and the telescope is to the right of the mount
  as described above. This is the easier position w.r.t. weatherproofing
  because we can leave the clutch accessible for use.

* The DEC head is rotated such that the dovetail plate & saddle are
  horizontal, the DEC clutch is down and the saddle knobs are up.

* The plane of the DEC bearing intersects the RA axis motor cover when the
  DEC head is rotated to the certain angles, as it would be during normal
  operation. This implies that weatherproofing attached to the DEC head or
  telescope may not extend over the DEC bearing at all close to the bearing,
  else it would collide with the RA motor cover.

* Therefore, the DEC bearing gap must be protected by a roof that attaches
  to the DEC motor cover side of the gap.

* The DEC head is slighly tapered (narrower near the saddle than the
  bearing), but enough it can be relied on to quickly drain away water
  that makes it under the roof. Therefore it is probably better to include
  a gutter on the DEC head to keep water that makes it under the roof from
  getting to the bearing & electronics.

* 31mm is the shortest distance between the DEC motor cover and the knobs of
  the saddle place screws. The weatherproofing for the bearing must fit into
  that space.

* The clutch handle may be rotated so that the tight position is ~parallel to
  the DEC axis or ~perpendicular to it (i.e. nearly tangent to the bearing
  cover). The former (parallel) lowers the maximum clearance above the DEC
  head that must be allowed for, but also raises the minimum clearance. 

* When the clutch handle is tight at ~parallel to the DEC axis, the top of
  the handle is at a constant distance from the axis (~63.35mm), and it
  occupies more than 31mm from the DEC bearing towards the saddle plate
  (actually reaching almost to the top of the DEC head. If in this position,
  then whether the clutch is tight or loose doesn't change whether the handle
  clears the weatherproofing: either the weatherproofing is in a good spot for
  rotating the DEC axis, or it blocks rotation (bad).

* When the clutch handle is tight at ~perpendicular to to the DEC axis, then
  the handle sticks up higher above the DEC head (i.e. farther from the DEC
  axis at the tip of the handle). However, it doesn't block placement of
  weatherproofing (overhanging roof) IFF we don't require that it be possible
  to rotate the unlocked axis with the roof in place.
